# A Global Transcriptional Atlas of the Effect of Sleep Loss in the Mouse Cortex

This repository shares all the code developed for the analysis of the "A Global Transcriptional Atlas of the Effect of Sleep Loss in the Mouse Cortex" paper.

At the link [https://rissolab.github.io/AtlasCortexSD/](https://rissolab.github.io/AtlasCortexSD/), in the Articles section, it is possible to retrieve all the 
reports for reproducing the entire analysis.

In some cases, because some of the steps are time demanding the code is reported, 
but not live executed. 
At the same time, the user has the possibility to reproduce the entire code by 
starting from the data released with this repository, but also running the 
following docker file [ghcr.io/RissoLab/AtlasCortexSD:latest](ghcr.io/RissoLab/v:latest)

# Abstract 

# Paper

# Data Availability

Sequencing data have been deposited in NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE211088. The bulk RNA-seq replicates (5 SD, 5 HC) were previously deposited in GEO under accession number GSE113754, and downloaded from GEO for this analysis. 

# Code Availability 

The code used in this article can be accessed via Github through the following link: [link]. The Allen Whole Cortex & Hippocampus - 10x genomics (v2021) reference dataset used for single-nuclear analysis, in a SingleCellExperiment object, has been made available at [https://github.com/drighelli/AllenInstituteBrainData](https://github.com/drighelli/AllenInstituteBrainData).
